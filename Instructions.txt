Instructions for installing:

Download the docker-compose by using the command:
sudo apt-get install docker-compose

When the install is complete do one of the followings steps(*) on the host machine for the Elasticsearch container to be able to run
 * sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
	Note: This is done at runtime so would be temporary so it would need to be entered after every reboot
or
 * Add the line to the file /etc/sysctl.conf: vm.max_map_count=262144
	Note: This is a perminate solution, the host needs to be rebooted after this command for it to take effect.
		There is a bug where it doesn't take affect, if after running, Kibana says it can't connect to elasticsearch,
		then run the other command sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144. After this it should work.

Next in order to run insight2 just enter (Make sure you're in the Insight2 directory, with the docker-compose.yml file)
sudo docker-compose up -d --build

After the command is entered it will install everything and be up and running.

Directory Information:
IMPORTANT: don't move/rename any of the files, the docker-compose.yml uses relative path to the files to place.
The file in Insight2/Elasticsearch called elasticsearch.yml file is the config files for elasticsearch container, You can modify the file
	to use whatever you wish, except lines (network.host:172.20.0.2, and http.port:9200) they are necessary for the containers
	to communicate.
The file in Insight2/Kibana called kibana.yml, the above lines apply, except the lines (server.port:5601,server.host:'0.0.0.0', 
	elasticsearch.url:"http://172.20.0.2:9200")

In the directory Insight2/Elasticsearch/Data is used to place into the Elastic search /usr/share/elasticsearch/data. So place your data in this directory
	The directory is also in the Enrichment contiainer

In the Enrichment container there is the src directory, this is for the python that will run and insert data into the elasticsearch directory.
	

Commands:
To enter a container and run commands(no braces): sudo docker attach [container name]
To exit the container one can enter: exit, this will close the container
	to avoid this while holding ctrl press p then q

To stop containers enter(no braces): sudo docker stop [containers names] or sudo docker kill [containers names]

To run containers re-enter: sudo docker-compose up -d
